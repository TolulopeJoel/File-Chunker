# ChunkIt Documentation

## Project Description

ChunkIt is a Telegram bot that enables users to split various file types (images, videos, archives, text files, and PDFs) into smaller chunks. This tool saves time and effort for users who need to manage and share large files by breaking them down into more manageable pieces.


## Motivation

I tried to send a video edited in iMovie to my uncle, but the file was too large for the platform. I couldn't find an easy software to split the file into smaller parts without making it bigger. So, I created ChunkIt to solve this problem and help others who face the same issue.

## Use Case

In our digital age, file size restrictions are a common headache. Whether you're a content creator, a professional sharing large documents, or just sending vacation photos, these limits can be a major roadblock. Existing solutions often compromise quality or require technical know-how.

ChunkIt aims to eliminate these frustrations by splitting large files into smaller, more manageable chunks. Here's how this helps:

1. Bypass size limits: By dividing a large file into smaller parts, you can send each chunk separately, effectively circumventing file size restrictions on various platforms.

2. Easier sharing: Smaller file chunks are quicker to upload and download, making sharing more convenient, especially in areas with slower internet connections.

3. Flexible storage: Chunked files can be stored across different devices or cloud services if a single location doesn't have enough space for the entire file.

4. Quality preservation: Unlike compression methods, chunking doesn't alter the file's content, maintaining the original quality.

Users can split their files into these manageable chunks without sacrificing quality or wasting time on complex processes. The recipient can then easily reassemble the chunks to reconstruct the original file.

## Features

- Efficient file splitting for various file types
- Support for images, videos, archives, text files, and PDFs
- Custom number of chunks
- Image file size reduction without quality loss
- Easy-to-use Telegram bot interface

## Getting Started

To use the ChunkIt bot, you'll need to have a Telegram account. You can find the bot by searching for its username (`@ChunkItBot`) in the Telegram app or by following the provided [link](https://t.me/ChunkItBot).

Once you've added the bot, you can start interacting with it by sending commands or uploading files.

## Usage

To split a file into chunks, follow these steps:

1. Send the file you want to split to the bot. Supported file types include images, videos, archives, text files, and PDFs.

2. The bot will ask you to specify the number of chunks you want the file to be split into. Reply with the desired number of chunks.

3. The bot will then confirm your choice. Reply with any positive response (e.g., "Yes", "Okay", "Sure") to proceed or any negative response (e.g., "No", "Cancel", "Nope") to cancel the operation.

After confirming, the bot will process the file and send you the chunks as separate files or file links.

## Commands

The ChunkIt bot supports the following commands:

- `/start`: Start the bot and get a welcome message.
- `/help`: Display the usage instructions.
- `/stats`: View the usage statistics.

## Ongoing Enhancements

- Merging split files
- Support for more file formats
- Integration with cloud storage services
- Customizable chunk sizes
- Batch processing of multiple files
