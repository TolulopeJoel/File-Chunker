# ChunkIt Documentation

## Introduction

ChunkIt is a Telegram bot that allows users to split various types of files (images, videos, archives, text files, and PDFs) into smaller chunks. The bot provides a convenient way to manage and share large files by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable pieces.

## Getting Started

To use the ChunkIt bot, you'll need to have a Telegram account. You can find the bot by searching for its username (`@ChunkItBot`) in the Telegram app or by following the provided [link](https://t.me/ChunkItBot).

Once you've added the bot, you can start interacting with it by sending commands or uploading files.

## Usage

To split a file into chunks, follow these steps:

1. Send the file you want to split to the bot. Supported file types include images, videos, archives, text files, and PDFs.

2. The bot will ask you to specify the number of chunks you want the file to be split into. Reply with the desired number of chunks.

3. The bot will then confirm your choice. Reply with "Yes" to proceed or "No" to cancel the operation.

After confirming, the bot will process the file and send you the chunks as separate files or file links.

## Commands

The ChunkIt bot supports the following commands:

- `/start`: Start the bot and get a welcome message.
- `/help`: Display the help message with instructions on how to use the bot.
- `/stats`: Display the statistics of usage.
- `/cancel`: Cancel the current operation.

## Error Handling

If an error occurs during the file splitting process, the bot will display an appropriate error message. Common error scenarios include:

- Unsupported file types
- File size limitations
- Network or server issues
